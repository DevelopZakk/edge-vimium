Microsoft Edge port of Vimium
=============================

### IMPORTANT
Even though this version basically works, it's an extremely immature version of a full port, and probably mostly broken. I invite you to try it and to join me with your own improvements.

### HOW TO INSTALL
* Install Node + NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Install Coffeescript
```
$ npm install -g coffee-script
```
* Clone this repo

```
* Install cake (if needed): https://github.com/cake-build/cake#1-install-the-cake-bootstrapper
* Build with cake

```
* Enable developer mode in Edge
